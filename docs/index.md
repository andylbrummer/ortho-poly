# Welcome!

Generate orthoganal polynomials of types: Laguerre, Legendre, Chebyshev and Hermite. The library is used primarily as an equation generator, so it't primary output is an array of coeficients. It's been used by WebGL projects to generate atomic orbital views and three dimensional quantum harmonic oscilator wave function views.
